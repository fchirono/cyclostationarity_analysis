Welcome to cyclostationarity_analysis's documentation!
======================================================

**cyclostationarity_analysis** is a Python package for running cyclostationary signal processing. It contains functions to generate test signals that exhibit cyclostationarity - i.e. its statistical properties vary in a *cyclic* fashion - and some functions for analysing such properties.

The code is available on `Github <https://github.com/fchirono/cyclostationarity_analysis>`_, and an example IPython Notebook can be accessed via `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/fchirono/cyclostationarity_analysis/blob/main/cyclostationary_analysis.ipynb>`_.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to :ref:`install <installation>` the project.

.. note::
	This project is under active development, and things may change rapidly!

`cyclostationarity_analysis` has its documentation hosted on Read the Docs.
